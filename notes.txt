PHP is a general purpose scripting language geared towards web development.

How PHP works?
- Browser sends a request to the server
- PHP Code is processed
- Server sends HTML back to the browser

PHP cannot be ran by itself it needs web server like apache or nginx

PHP is often used with LAMP(Linux apache mysql php) stack
Tools such as XAMPP(Cross platform, apache, mysql, php, perl) & MAMP give you everything you need to develop PHP
websites and apps on your local machine including a MySQL database.

When ready, you setup your prod server on a web host such as Lincode.
